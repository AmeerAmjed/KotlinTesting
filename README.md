# Kotlin Testing
Problem solving with testing by Kotlin/junit5

Using the concept of TDD which you learned in [Testing course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEPx7DrqAqKCMGYKUxo2d0rkjo1SQqWoC) write a function with
all possible test case in Kotlin to achieve the following requirements:
it should accept a list of strings, all strings should be from one character and the
character should be either “a” or “b” and return the percentage of “a” repetitions. as
an example if the input list was [“a”,”b”,”b”] the function should return a double value
33.3, try to think about edge cases as much as you can and test them, if the list
contain a wrong value you shouldn’t calculate the percentage of “a” repetitions
instead you should return -1.
